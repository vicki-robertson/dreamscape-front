## Description

This project involved the creation of multiple-page responsive website, using React, Next.js, PHP, and Laravel. The site design, as specified by the fictional client 'Happy Travel' via a detailed [Figma mock-up](https://www.figma.com/file/twPJOzEo5hZJZ7srsEt10y/HappyTravel?type=design&node-id=4-1343&mode=design&t=Ws3hTyk3DDJ71bok-0), features various unique elements and pages. These include a search bar for finding holiday destinations with ease, a registration form for new users, and a login form for existing users. The site itself features a gallery of personalized holiday destinations that registered users are able to add to, edit, and delete, and users without an account are able to view and search.

## Testing
In the front-end, this project used Vitest for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing. Combined, these tests verified that the various pages and their components were being rendered properly while also ensuring a smooth user experience by simulating actions such as logging in and searching destinations. 

In the back-end, this project used PHPUnit to test user routes and endpoint access when authorized or not.
